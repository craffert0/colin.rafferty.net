      <a href="eBirdAlert/">eBird Alert!</a>

      shows rare bird sightings in your area, found from the
      checklists your fellow birders have submitted to eBird -- a
      global online database of bird records used by hundreds of
      thousands of birders around the world.

      <a href="photoTracking/">Photo Tracking</a>

      stores your location information throughout the day, and once
      you've synchronized your camera's photos to iCloud, it will set
      their locations based on the timestamps in your photos.

      <p/>

      <a href="recursed/">Recursed!</a>

      is your iOS integration into the Recurse Center. See who
      is at the Hub or who the current batch members are. While at the Hub,
      use doorbot or check in. Search for fellow recursers by name, keyword,
      and/or batch.
