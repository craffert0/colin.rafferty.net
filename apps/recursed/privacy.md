# Recursed! Privacy

The *Recursed!* app requests your location to determine if you are near the Hub and are therefore allowed to use Doorbot or to Check In. If you use email/password to login, the app uploads a hash of that data to create an authentication token, and immediately deletes it.

Any terms used on the search screen are uploaded to the Recurse servers to serve the query.

No other user data (including location) is transmitted to any server.
