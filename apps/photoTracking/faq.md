# Photo Tracking FAQ

#### How does *Photo Tracking* use my data?

All location tracking and photo management is done on the phone, and no data is uploaded to any servers.

#### Why the locations wrong?

Most likely the date and time on your camera is not correct.

#### What happens if I forget to *Fix Photos*?

It's okay. You can start and stop tracking as often as you like, and when you click *Fix Photos*, it will fix all photos going as far as 30 days back.
