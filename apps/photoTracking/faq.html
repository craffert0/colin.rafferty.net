<h1>Photo Tracking FAQ</h1>

<h4>How does <em>Photo Tracking</em> use my data?</h4>

<p>All location tracking and photo management is done on the phone, and no data is uploaded to any servers.</p>

<h4>Why the locations wrong?</h4>

<p>Most likely the date and time on your camera is not correct.</p>

<h4>What happens if I forget to <em>Fix Photos</em>?</h4>

<p>It's okay. You can start and stop tracking as often as you like, and when you click <em>Fix Photos</em>, it will fix all photos going as far as 30 days back.</p>
