# Photo Tracking

Take pictures with your digital camera, import them to Apple Photos, and use Photo Tracking to add locations to them.

Do you have a digital camera that does not add location information to your photos? Do you sync your photos to Apple's iCloud? Then this is the app for you. *Photo Tracking*  will store your location information throughout the day, and once you've synchronized your camera's photos to iCloud, it will set their locations based on the timestamps in your photos.

### Instructions

1. Open the app and tap *Start Tracking*. You can now close the app.
1. Go out and take pictures with your digital camera. Don't forget your phone.
1. When you get home, open the app and tap *Stop Tracking*.
1. Sync your camera to any Apple device.
1. In the app, tap *Fix Photos*
1. Profit!

### Privacy

*Photo Tracking* requires your location and photo library access to add location information to your photos. It will never upload your location or any other data to any server.

All location tracking and photo processing is done on your phone, and no information leaves the phone, aside from the new locations on your iCloud photos.
